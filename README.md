# Git Punch Card

## Prerequisites

- macOS (other operating systems probably work, but has never been tested).
- Python 3. If you're still on Python 2 carefully read and upgrade: https://opensource.com/article/19/5/python-3-default-mac#what-to-do
- Requires git-punchcard. Read: https://pypi.org/project/git-punchcard/

## How to Use

- Clone all the repos you wish to generate punch cards for into a directory.
- Clone this repo into a **different directory** and cd into it.
- `chmod +x generate-punch-card.sh`
- `./generate-punch-card.sh <directory where you cloned the repos to e.g ~/Desktop/repos/*/.git> -prefix <project_name> -since <start_date> -until <end_date> -timezone <timezone e.g. UTC+08:00>`

That will generate png files for each interval between `since` and `until`.

### Options

| Short 	| Long 	| Note 	|
|-	|-	|-	|
| `-d` 	| `--directory` 	| The directory where the repos are located at. E.g. `~/Desktop/repos/*/.git`. Note the wildcard, you can use this to scan multiple repos in that directory. 	|
| `-p` 	| `--prefix` 	| Prefix for the image name. Will be used as the chart name prefix as well. 	|
| `-s` 	| `--since` 	| Start date of the scan. Must be in the format `dd.mm.yyyy`. E.g. `29.09.2020`. 	|
| `-u` 	| `--until` 	| End date of the scan. Must be in the format `dd.mm.yyyy`. E.g. `29.09.2020`. 	|
| `-t` 	| `--timezone` 	| Timezone to be used for reporting. Must be in the format `UTC+8:00`. 	|
